My first "vintage" synthesizer. Purchased when I realized the sound quality on the [SH-201](/synthesizers/roland/sh201) was really letting me down. I was instantly hooked on the lush chords and pads it produced when run through the built-in chorus. THIS is what Roland poly synths should sound like. Some argue that the DCO's are not quite as flavorful as true analog VCO's but I'll be damned if the Juno doesn't just sound great. Sure it may not sound "alive" as some of the warbling VCO poly's out at the same time but with some careful programming it can sound quite nice and lush. Even without careful programming it still sounds really good, its damn near impossible to make it sound bad.
