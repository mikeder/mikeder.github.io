"sqweebking" is an alias I've used on the internet for a long time, it has no real meaning, it's just unique. Sometimes I record synthesizer jams and upload them to [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/sqweebking/tracks), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/synthatik/videos?view_as=subscriber) or [Bandcamp](http://sqweebking.bandcamp.com).
