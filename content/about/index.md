A fan of coding, gaming and synthesizers. Previous Toyota/Lexus master of diagnostics and repair (2006-2014). Current cloud architect and software engineer (2014-2020).

This site will probably contain notes about things I'm working on currently, or thoughts about things I worked on in the past with no particular theme.
