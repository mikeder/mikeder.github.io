On day 3 I made use of some different gear, like the TTSHv4 an Ibanez UE400 analog multi effects rack and the great sounding EQ on the Tascam M216. I'm making use of a new project on the Keystep Pro for each day, so I may be able to return to some of these jams for more fleshing out in the future. Todays result was a washed out acid techno vibe.

Gear Used:
* TTSHv4
* Elektron Digitakt
* x0xb0x
* Ibanez UE400
* Lexicon Alex
* Arturia Keystep Pro
* Tascam M216
* Soundcraft Signature 12 MTK
