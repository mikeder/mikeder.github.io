Jamuary 2024 is starting off with "relearning" my studio. Coming off of a week long rearrangement, re-racking and re-cabling effort, it will take me some time to get comfortable with the new layout and connectivity of things.

Despite the reorganization, I still managed 2 different jams today. Making good use of the rack mount synths I have been neglecting for years. I recorded and put up a video for the first, but the second jam is my favorite - so I shared it on my music server [here](https://music.sqweeb.net/share/j9uypbVD8S#/). Eventually, the whole Jamuary 2024 playlist will be shared [here](https://music.sqweeb.net/share/CB3UkMtezB#/).

Gear Used:
* Novation A-Station
* Studio Elecronics SE-1
* Elektron Digitakt
