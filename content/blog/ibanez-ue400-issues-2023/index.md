"Main" output does not have signal when effect is engaged, "Stereo Chorus Output" does have signal. The "stereo" output seems to be a copy/phase inversion from the main output. The signal is available on the "Ext Send" output from the effect loop jacks.

The "fully effected" signal may only be available on the "Stereo Chorus Output" if the chorus is last in the "insta-patch" chain. Will have to test this theory some more.

- Performed full calibration, everything in spec or close enough - the Lissajous X/Y mode check of the phaser is not perfect on a digital oscilloscope. 
- Tried swapping 2 AN6552 op amps in the compressor/output area with no change.
  - All op amps are AN6552 except for 1 TL082 near the compressor.
- Tried swapping 2 2SK30A-Y FETs (Q603? & Q603?) in the compressor/output area with no change.
