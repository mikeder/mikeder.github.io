Random game ideas that I've had, smallish mini game type things.

## Spelunkin' Spuds

A side scrolling cave spelunking game where you play a potato, roughly modeled after Mr. Potato Head, that can roll, jump and flop your way through a procedurally generated cave system.

## Burnout Championship

Players perform sick burnouts in their customizable burnout vehicles of a varying range of burnout pads. Score is based on percentage of burnout pad used, amount of smoke produced, length of burnout, crash avoidance. Vehicle damage can be applied to the front end/radiator area, which will affect the temperature of the engine. Players must try to get the highest score before blowing their engine, bonus points for popping tires before the engine fails or time runs out.
