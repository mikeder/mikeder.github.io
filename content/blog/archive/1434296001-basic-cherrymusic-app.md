Found this posted to the CherryMusic github project page. It is a basic wrapper that functions just like the regular Web app but contained in an android app that can save login creds and may work as a Chrome and Mozilla alternative.

- may require that you allow app installation from unknown sources but should be fine to allow.

Once installed goto settings and put this url in the address bar: http://cherry.sqweeb.net 

Add your username and password and hit save, you should be good to go, let me know how goes.
