I tried the recommended method [here](https://help.ubnt.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013737328-Ubiquiti-Devices-KRACK-Vulnerability) without luck. When done from the UniFi controller the upgrade would just not happen, no error given as to why. I then tried it directly on the AP and found that it wasn't able to verify the SSL cert from UBNT's site.

So I logged into another machine and pulled down the .bin file

<pre class=prettyprint>

Started up a SimpleHTTPServer to serve the file locally:

</pre>

This started the upgrade but was still not successful, still no indication why yet..


#### ...turns out I just had to upgrade to a lower version first.

AP started on version: `3.4.19.3477`

Upgraded Unifi controller from `4.8.20-8422` to `5.5.24-9806`

Unifi controller came back up, automatic firmware upgrade kicked in. AP upgraded to `3.8.14`

Applied custom upgrade to AP from UBNT site to `3.9.3.7537`
