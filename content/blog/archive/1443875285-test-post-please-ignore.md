[Cherrymusic](http://cherry.sqweeb.net) is out and [Subsonic](http://subsonic.sqweeb.net) is in. An issue thread came up on the [Cherrymusic](https://github.com/devsnd/cherrymusic) github that asked if there was a good android client to use with cherrymusic, and there isn't. There is a wrapper that only sort of half-ass works and then a shitty mobile implementation when using Chrome. Someone in the comments suggested an existing app for Subsonic be used as a guide or starting point for a Cherrymusic app. So this got me searching to figure out what Subsonic is and low and behold its exactly what I wanted in Cherrymusic but only previously knew existed in Plex. Plex was an option at one point and it does look nice but as soon as I figured out that its mobile apps cost any amount of money I got disinterested. Now looking back I may have been too quick to pass on Plex as using Subsonic has me considering donating to the dev anyway.
