Well I made backups of the little bit of stuff I still had on the old server and am now going to list them for sale on craigslist.

3 Dell Poweredge SC1425 Servers - $120

Take all 3 servers for $120, server 1 was my main workhorse for the better part of a year as I learned VMWare ESXi, I had it running 6 or 7 Linux VM's without a hiccup.

Replaced the memory in server 1 with this kit just a few months ago:

Also replaced the thermal paste on all CPU's with Artic Silver last summer and temps are lower and more even across the cores.
