* __Server turned off__ **(9/22/16)**
    * I've decided to turn off the server for now, due to lack of traffic. The virtual machine will be backed up and stored in its current state but will remain powered off until its needed again.



* __Server Update, Map Wipe, Performance Increases!__ **(9/1/16)**
    * The server was updated and map wiped today, the map size was increased from **3000 to 3555**
    * Server tick rate was increased from **30 to 60**
    * An underlying storage issue was resolved resulting in lower server load and faster loading times
    * Come noob out with us on a fresh server!
