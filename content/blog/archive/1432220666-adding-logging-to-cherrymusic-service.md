This morning I added some logging functionality to the <a href="https://github.com/mikeder/cherrymusic-conf/tree/add-log" target="_blank">cherrymusic service script</a> that lives in /etc/init.d/cherrymusic. I have a couple issues going on with the music server that are going to require some log digging. One of which I've already fixed: Some of the Web Rips sub directories would open up empty. Upon review the logs when accessing those folders I found this:

<pre class="prettyprint" lang-bsh>
[150521-14:10] ERROR   : [21/May/2015:14:10:41] HTTP Traceback (most recent call last):

UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character '\udce2' in position 29: surrogates not allowed
</pre>

This is obviously because my filename sanitizing in the music-scraper script I use is lacking. So I found a decent bash script for renaming filenames that contain invalid characters.

<pre class="prettyprint" lang-bsh>
#!/usr/bin/env bash
find "$1" -depth -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do
  d="$( dirname "$file" )"
  f="$( basename "$file" )"
  new="${f//[^a-zA-Z0-9\/\. \&_()\-]/}"
  if [ "$f" != "$new" ]      # if equal, name is already clean, so leave alone
  then
    if [ -e "$d/$new" ]
    then
      echo "Notice: \"$new\" and \"$f\" both exist in "$d":"
      ls -ld "$d/$new" "$d/$f"
    else
      echo mv "$file" "$d/$new"      # remove "echo" to actually rename things
    fi
  fi
done
</pre>

I saved this script in /home/cherrymusic so I can run it if I start to see this issue again but ideally I'd like to fix the music-scraper script so it doesn't allow these characters through in the first place.

<pre class="prettyprint">
# Dump all filenames to be changed into a text file to be reviewed
cherrymusic@cherrym-ct:~$ ./rename.sh /mnt/vm-storage-1/Music/Web\ Rips > rename.txt
</pre>

Once everything was looking good in the test run dump into replace.txt I removed the "echo" from the mv command in the rename script and ran it again to actually perform the renaming.

Finally I added a cron job to be run daily to rotate the cherrymusic log files so they don't get too huge. I still need to add another line to remove logs older than a week or so, but that can wait a bit.

<pre class="prettyprint" lang-bsh>
# m h  dom mon dow   command
@daily /home/cherrymusic/logrotate.sh
</pre>
