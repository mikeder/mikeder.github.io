changed mount options:

- Before: defaults,noatime,nodiratime,barrier=1,data=ordered,errors=remount-ro
- After: relatime,barrier=0,errors=remount-ro

I also found there were some rouge monitoring processes running after a host reboot, collectd, splunkd, and filebeat were all running from previous installs. I hunted down and removed/stopped/deleted all associated files I could find on the host and the containers.

```bash
find / -name 'splunk'
find / -name 'collectd'
find/ -name 'filebeat'
```

After these changes I found that the IOWait spikes were still occurring at ~15-20min intervals. Doing some more digging I found something interesting, it seems that the /dev/sda device is the source of delay, and when checking smartctl I found that the firmware is different on this drive compared to a drive of the same model:

#### /dev/sda

At this time it isn't clear if it is even possible to update or change the firmware on these drives..

Also look into further fstab tweaks:

# Update 9/1/16 - 10:35AM

After looking back over the above documents, mount option tweaks for SSD's and such I realized I was overlooking one important task; fstrim. Most posts discussed enabling the discard mount option for SSD's but then other posts suggested this option causes a huge decrease in performance and to instead create a cron job that runs fstrim daily or weekly. I enabled a daily TRIM using the following script:

```bash
/etc/cron.daily/fstrim

#!/bin/sh

PATH=/bin:/sbin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin

ionice -n 7 fstrim -v /
ionice -n 7 fstrim -v /var/lib/vz

```

I then manually ran the two commands to apply the trim job now and there was an immediate improvement. I am no longer seeing 15-20% spikes in IOWAIT every 20-30 minutes!!
