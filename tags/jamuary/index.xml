      <description>Some lessons learned from my studio jams during Jamuary 2023.
Use a DAW template! Setup the mixer and audio interface to work generically enough with the outboard gear you want to use. Record stems and a mixer &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; if you can. If the main mix is good enough great, job done. If not you have stems to &amp;ldquo;remix&amp;rdquo; the main performance. Levels are easier to correct with less noise, in the digital domain.</description>
