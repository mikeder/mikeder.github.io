      <description>Building things that people can depend on requires a degree of planning and a willingness to stick to best practices, despite minor upfront timeline inconveniences.

Burger World example: Burger World has 3 main objectives: Serve customer orders at drive through in 3min or less. Serve customer orders at walk up counter in 5min or less. Less than 1% of orders result in corrective action. First assume that all other operations are working as designed, we only monitor and alert on deviations from the primary objectives.</description>
