			<h1>Roland MC-505</h1>

				<p>The Roland MC-505 was my first piece of kit, and my entry point to a new hobby in electronic music production. I was quickly overwhelmed once I had a look at the manual, it was huge and I had no idea what any of the features were.
I didn&rsquo;t even know the first thing about music production or music theory for that matter. All I knew is that this chunky groovebox made some cool sounds and you could tweak them and combine them in all sorts of new ways!</p>
<p>The 505 is a solid piece of kit if you get one that has been treated well. I purchased mine in March 2008 for $319 and it was damn near mint condition. The only issue I&rsquo;ve had with it is the LCD screen going out, which apparently is a fairly common fault for most 2 line LCD&rsquo;s from this era. I was able to get a new replacement screen, in green, for about $50USD in 2009.</p>
