###Links:
* [GitHub Home](http://github.com/mikeder)
* [SqweebNet](http://sqweeb.net)

- [] Reasearch bootstrap vs. strapdown
- [] Rewrite player creation script in Python
- [] Set up NOC-tools VM
- [] Finalize virtwin7 jumpbox configuration

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
###12/15/14 - Updates
- [x] DNS updated at GoDaddy.com to point mikeder.net to the github.io servers. 
- [x] CNAME file in place in the repo

Thinking through updates and what not, testing TTL. The GoDaddy DNS changes
took a little longer than expected to propagate ~45min. Although this may have
been off due to my browser caching the default 404 page from github.io

Now its just a matter of learing the in's and out's of strapdown and bootstrap
to flesh out this site a bit.

###12/14/14 - Initialized
Tonight I took a few minutes to get a new github account set up to separate 
from my sqweebking/sqweeb.net account and create my first repo for this website.
http://github.com/mikeder -> http://github.com/mikeder/mikeder.github.io
I then cloned this repo locally to create my index.html file. Which for now is
the only hosted file here. I still need to set up the DNS forwarding for the 
GoDaddy domain mikeder.net and put a CNAME file in the repo.

###12/13/14 - Realized
Discovered github.io aka GitHub Pages via this YouTube video:

I decided to give this a shot for my personal domain mikeder.net, which I
purchased on GoDaddy a couple of months ago. This will be used as a personal
work log and journal for things I may be working on or thinking about it my 
day to day activities.
