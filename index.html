For some reason it seems the CherryMusic updates aren't sticking, the about page still shows 0.33.0 despite my local repo being up to date. Further investigation is required.

This morning I actually finished the CherryMusic upgrade, I got distracted last night by an invite to do the VoG raid in Destiny. Since I had never run the raid before I jumped at the chance, its difficult for me because it requires 6 
players and I dont have that many friends who play. I ended up having to leave 
before we finished anyway. The stage I came in on ended up taking us several hours, probably because I was too low level to do enough damage.

Anyway the CherryMusic upgrade 0.33.0 -> 0.34.0 is done now.
Last night I was trying to do some webrips with my [Reddit music scraper script](https://github.com/sqweebking/music-scraper/blob/master/scrape.py)
and I realized I forgot the command I used for cleaning non-UTF8 characters from
the resulting files so I figured id log my process here.

```
# Scrape a subreddit for new songs
$ rsdc electronicmusic
# Move to the scraped music output directory
$ cd /home/music/scraped/out
# Run detox on all subfolders and files
$ detox -r *
# Copy all new files to the NAS(/mnt/webrips/)
$ cp -Ruv *
```

I had started to write a bash script to do this all for me so that I can just
have a cron job run it for me nightly but I ran into some issues with output
from the scraper script. Id like to retain output so that the cron emails will
give me some insight as to how the scrape is working. Another item for the TODO.

Testing out the new .vimrc as seen in:

http://youtu.be/rENXp-AWZmk?list=UUd26IHBHcbtxD7pUdnIgiCw

My .vimrc:
```
colorscheme elflord
syntax on
syntax enable
let @n = '/Log:^Mo^M^M^M^M^[kkkk80i-^[j! date^Mi### ^[^Mjzzi'
```
The last line there is important, it is the macro I can now use to start a new 
entry in the log. When I press @n vim will automatically jump to the bottom of
the 'Start of Log:' line and insert a date/time stamp and put me in insert mode 
ready to type out the entry. Cool stuff, all of which is still very new and 
exciting to me for reasons.

###12/15/14 - Updates
- [x] DNS updated at GoDaddy.com to point mikeder.net to the github.io servers. 
- [x] CNAME file in place in the repo

Thinking through updates and what not, testing TTL. The GoDaddy DNS changes
took a little longer than expected to propagate ~45min. Although this may have
been off due to my browser caching the default 404 page from github.io

Now its just a matter of learing the in's and out's of strapdown and bootstrap
to flesh out this site a bit.

###12/14/14 - Initialized
Tonight I took a few minutes to get a new github account set up to separate 
from my sqweebking/sqweeb.net account and create my first repo for this website.
http://github.com/mikeder -> http://github.com/mikeder/mikeder.github.io
I then cloned this repo locally to create my index.html file. Which for now is
the only hosted file here. I still need to set up the DNS forwarding for the 
GoDaddy domain mikeder.net and put a CNAME file in the repo.

###12/13/14 - Realized
Discovered github.io aka GitHub Pages via this YouTube video: 
http://youtu.be/rENXp-AWZmk?list=UUd26IHBHcbtxD7pUdnIgiCw
I decided to give this a shot for my personal domain mikeder.net, which I
purchased on GoDaddy a couple of months ago. This will be used as a personal
work log and journal for things I may be working on or thinking about it my 
day to day activities.
