      <description>&amp;ldquo;sqweebking&amp;rdquo; is an alias I&amp;rsquo;ve used on the internet for a long time, it has no real meaning, it&amp;rsquo;s just unique. Sometimes I record synthesizer jams and upload them to SoundCloud, YouTube or Bandcamp.

      <title>Roland SH-201</title>

      <description>My first true synthesizer, a virtual analog poly synth that I never really clicked with. The sound on the SH-201 always seemed quite thin and harsh to me, although to be fair was a quite novice sound designer at the time and probably didn&amp;rsquo;t give it a real workout.
The SH-201 was OK at best, it tended to have some bad aliasing in higher pitches and just never sound very high quality to me.</description>

      <description>The Roland MC-505 was my first piece of kit, and my entry point to a new hobby in electronic music production. I was quickly overwhelmed once I had a look at the manual, it was huge and I had no idea what any of the features were. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even know the first thing about music production or music theory for that matter. All I knew is that this chunky groovebox made some cool sounds and you could tweak them and combine them in all sorts of new ways!</description>

      <title>Roland Juno-6</title>

      <description>My first &amp;ldquo;vintage&amp;rdquo; synthesizer. Purchased when I realized the sound quality on the SH-201 was really letting me down. I was instantly hooked on the lush chords and pads it produced when run through the built-in chorus. THIS is what Roland poly synths should sound like. Some argue that the DCO&amp;rsquo;s are not quite as flavorful as true analog VCO&amp;rsquo;s but I&amp;rsquo;ll be damned if the Juno doesn&amp;rsquo;t just sound great.</description>
