		Building things that people can depend on requires a degree of planning and a willingness to stick to best practices, despite minor upfront timeline inconveniences. When things change, those changes should be documented and communicated to those people that rely on it, quickly and reliably.
I had a conversation at work today about a piece of software my team was integrating with, suddenly failing to return results to a request our server was making.

		No, I am not happy with the results.
America has fallen for the worst con man in history, again.
Trump has no respect for our country, the Constitution, Democracy or anyone other than himself. He ran a campaign full of hate speech, attacks on his opponents at every opportunity, and his supporters just lap it up as if hes the second coming of Christ, what a disgrace. He and his network of right wing propaganda pushers spread misinformation 24/7 and the result is a cult like following that parrot his words despite their blatant contradiction with reality.

		Notes from my effort to replace bevy_renet with lightyear in my “WIP” game.
Renet is a popular server authoritative networking library for the Bevy game engine. I started using it for a new game I’m working on and really liked its simplicity from the start. Eventually though, I realized I wanted to target WASM for my game and Renet does not currently support websockets or webtransport. Another up and coming library is lightyear - its got a very active main contributor/maintainer in the Bevy Discord and it comes with support for WASM via websockets or webtransport and also supports crossplay between protocols as well as advanced replication features like client side prediction, rollback and snapshot interpolation, and many more!

	<div class="container">
		On day 3 I made use of some different gear, like the TTSHv4 an Ibanez UE400 analog multi effects rack and the great sounding EQ on the Tascam M216. I’m making use of a new project on the Keystep Pro for each day, so I may be able to return to some of these jams for more fleshing out in the future. Todays result was a washed out acid techno vibe.

		On day 2 I didn’t get a jam recorded - I spent my free time finalizing some wiring in the patchbays to some Boss micro rack effects units. I didn’t feel too bad about missing a day since I got a couple jams recorded on day 1, will resume for day 3.

		Jamuary 2024 is starting off with “relearning” my studio. Coming off of a week long rearrangement, re-racking and re-cabling effort, it will take me some time to get comfortable with the new layout and connectivity of things.
Despite the reorganization, I still managed 2 different jams today. Making good use of the rack mount synths I have been neglecting for years. I recorded and put up a video for the first, but the second jam is my favorite - so I shared it on my music server here.

		It took me a few attempts to figure out a good way to backup photos from an iPhone and Macbook to a proper format on an external NAS, so I figured I’d write it down.
First, import all the photos from your iPhone(s) onto the Macbook. This should put them in your local Photos library, and will probably start tagging them with “Memories” and location information.
Once all the photos are imported into the Photos app, go to the “Library” tab on the left.
