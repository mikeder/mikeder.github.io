            <p>A collection of past performance reviews, kept for posterity and reference, should I need contacts for future opportunities.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mike remains one of our strongest engineers with a pragmatic approach to solutioning. He is knowledgeable of both our systems as well as the technology and tooling that we leverage. Overall, he has had a strong year.</p>
<p>In the first half he led the SKU migration project to a successful delivery. The delivery was smooth and had few issues post-launch. He was then asked to lead two teams: the combination of our Customer and Commerce teams. This was a challenging ask as Mike had to lead a team that was understaffed with a large surface area of services and engineers of varying degrees of experience, but he has made it work and the team has been delivering on its commitments. Areas of opportunity for Mike lie in not taking on as much on his own and in how he communicates in certain scenarios.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Over the past year Mike has tackled large, complex problems with a surface area covering not just his team, but the entirety of the program. He is a strong partner to Product Management and Production. They not only trust his ability to deliver high quality pragmatic solutions as committed, but they also see him stepping up to help even with situations outside of his direct scope. Engineers trust him and seek his advice, and this has directly leveled up the capability of our engineers across the program. Feedback is consistent that he is performing above his current level.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During the past year the commerce team has migrated the entire set of services from legacy Python code to more robust Go microservices as well as support next generation consoles and additional sales channels such as the Epic store.</p>
<p>Mike Eder is one of the core members of the commerce team and much of the success that we have had is a result of his efforts, resilience and willingness to learn and try new methodologies when faced with seemingly unsurmountable technical challenges.</p>
<p>Mike Eder took ownership of the entire project and performed as mentor for more junior developers, architect and lead on the most complex problem sets, and the voice of reason when mediating technical differences between both internal and external team members.</p>
<p>Finally, his dedication to both the team and the company is apparent in all of his actions and his work ethic and commitment to those around him speak volumes to his character.</p>
